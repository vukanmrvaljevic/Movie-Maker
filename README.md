## App Title:
Movie-Maker App

This app will serve as a base for people who want to make there ideal movies, there will be a section for description of what they want to make. A section where they can add a list of actors, and actresses, along with any other deitals that they need. I will also design the app/website where with each section im going to create a own sub-section so these things are seperated and more organized.

## MVP:
1. Make it able to add a list, and description of there movie
2. Make it Responsive
3. Give it a smooth transition from page to page
4. Give the user the ability to add pictures of there actors and acctresses 

## Post-MVP:
1. Add Music in the background
2. Open up the ability to create an account 
3. Create a section of the app/website where the user can upload the finished product.

## SWOT Analysis:
My strength heading into this project is the design aspect, the weakness is adding all this features and making sure the App doesnt break, and making sure the product is usablle. I plan on overcoming anything negative that comes my way by looking it up on Google, Youtube or if that doesn't work asking one of the teachers for help.

## Code Snippet

```
Ther reasson why this is the line of code i am proud of is it gave me a lot of problems. I could not figure it out for the life of me. Even though it looks simple its something that made me happy.
